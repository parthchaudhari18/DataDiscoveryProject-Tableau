# Data Discovery Project: Regional and Socioeconomic Analysis of Cancer Trends

## Overview

This project, conducted in collaboration with Rochester Regional Health (RRH), analyzes cancer incidence and mortality across the United States, with a specific focus on New York State. By leveraging data visualization and statistical analysis, the study uncovers key trends and actionable insights to support RRH in strategic planning and healthcare interventions. 

Key objectives include:
- Identifying high-risk regions.
- Examining socioeconomic factors influencing cancer outcomes.
- Providing recommendations to enhance cancer care and community health initiatives.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Sourced data includes attributes such as zip codes, state identifiers, poverty estimates, median income, population estimates, cancer incidence rates, and mortality rates.
   - Focus on socioeconomic factors like poverty and median income relative to cancer outcomes.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Standardized and cleaned datasets for consistency and accuracy.
   - Emphasis on variables like incidence rates, death rates, median income, and poverty percentage.

3. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
   - **Tools**: Tableau was used to create visualizations, including:
     - **Bar Charts**: Visualizing incidence and death rates by county and state.
     - **Scatter Plots**: Correlating socioeconomic factors with cancer outcomes.
     - **Maps**: Highlighting high-risk regions spatially.

4. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Derive insights from visualizations to guide RRH's strategy for addressing disparities and prioritizing interventions.

## Key Findings

### 1. Regional Trends
- States like New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and California exhibit the highest cancer incidence rates.
- Southern and Central U.S. regions face disproportionately high cancer incidence and mortality rates.

### 2. Socioeconomic Correlations
- **Poverty**: Positive correlation with cancer mortality rates, indicating that higher poverty regions have worse outcomes.
- **Median Income**: Negative correlation with mortality rates, suggesting that wealthier regions benefit from better healthcare access and outcomes.

### 3. New York State Analysis
- Western and central counties exhibit higher incidence and mortality rates.
- Socioeconomic factors such as poverty and median income strongly influence cancer outcomes.

## Recommendations for Rochester Regional Health (RRH)

1. **Community Outreach**:
   - Educational campaigns in high-poverty regions to promote early detection and prevention.

2. **Healthcare Access**:
   - Expand facilities and services in underserved regions.
   - Use mobile clinics and telemedicine to reach remote areas.

3. **Clinical Research**:
   - Invest in research initiatives for innovative cancer treatments.

4. **Targeted Interventions**:
   - Focus on improving early detection and affordable care in low-income communities.

## Tools Used

- **Tableau**: For advanced visualizations and geographic mapping.
- **Python** (optional): Potential for further data preprocessing and analysis.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the intersection of socioeconomic factors and cancer outcomes, emphasizing the need for targeted healthcare interventions in high-risk regions. By implementing the outlined recommendations, RRH can strengthen its role as a leader in cancer care, addressing disparities and improving community health outcomes.
